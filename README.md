11	Write a Python script that prints prime numbers less than20.
12	Write a python program to find factorial of a number using Recursion.
13	Write a program that accepts the lengths of three sides of a triangle as inputs. The program output should indicate whether or not the triangle is aright triangle (Recall from the Pythagorean Theorem that in a right triangle, the square of one side equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides).

15	Write a python program to define a module and import a specific function in that module to another program.
16	Write a script named copyfile.py. This script should prompt the user for the names of two text files. The contents of the first file should be input and written to the second file.
17	Write a program that inputs a text file. The program should print all of the unique words in the file in alphabetical order.
18	Write a Python class to convert an integer to a roman numeral.
19	Write a Python class to implement pow (x, n)
20	Write a Python class to reverse a string word by word.
